# stickysnippets

- 2022-08-08: This was one of my first full projects I ever wrote in Python; looking back there are many improvements I could make, needs a way to open files a new sticky notes, needs better settings config, etc.

- I made Sticky Snippets because when I opened the Windows Sticky Note application I realized you couldn't save your notes to a file.


- In this application you can write a simple to-do list or a write a little script in your language of choice, save with the extension of your choosing and run later.

- This also works well with code snippets because you can save with your extensionof choice.

- This should be compatiable with Linux, Mac & Windows since its based on Tkinter
